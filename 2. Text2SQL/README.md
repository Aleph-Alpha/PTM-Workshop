# Text-to-SQL with PhariaAI

## Task

Build a **Text-to-SQL System** that:

1. Accepts natural language questions in a chat-like input (e.g., *"Show me the top 5 customers by total orders"*).
2. Translates the question into an SQL query using a **PhariaAI skill**.
3. Executes the SQL query against the Northwind database.
4. Returns and displays the results in a user-friendly UI.
5. Is exposed to end-users as a **custom application inside Pharia Assistant**.

**Key Challenge**: The system must accurately translate diverse natural language queries into correct SQL statements, handling various query complexities from simple selections to complex joins and aggregations.

**Deliverables**

- A functioning Pharia Custom Application that runs the Text-to-SQL pipeline end-to-end.
- Benchmarked solution on PhariaStudio demonstrating quality metrics on the provided test set.
- Present your solution at the end of the workshop.

**Tools & Data Provided**

- Classic Northwind database (SQLite3 version) simulating an e-commerce dataset.
- A test dataset with 100 curated examples for evaluation.
- Database schema extraction utility (`db_service.py`).
- PhariaAI

### About the Northwind Database

The **Northwind database** is a classic sample database that simulates a typical e-commerce dataset. It includes tables for customers, products, orders, employees, suppliers, and more, making it ideal for demonstrating SQL query capabilities.

### Data Structure

**Few-shot Examples**: Each entry in `data/di/examples.json` contains:
- `question`: Natural language question
- `query`: Corresponding SQL query (stored as metadata)

**Test Data**: Each entry in `data/test-data/examples.json` contains:
- Natural language question
- Expected SQL query

**Database Schemas**: Located in `data/test-data/database_schema/`:
- `car_1.sql`
- `concert_singer.sql`
- `employee_hire_evaluation.sql`
- `flight_2.sql`
- `pets_1.sql`

---

## Tools

- **Pharia Custom Application template** – quickest way to scaffold the chat UI and connect your flow.
- **PhariaStudio** – develop, debug and benchmark your solution.
- **PhariaSearch Document Index** – store few-shot examples for retrieval-augmented generation.
- **PhariaAssistant** – Use the PhariaAssistant to deploy and showcase your solution.
- **Database Service** (`db_service.py`) – Extract schema and execute queries.

Full documentation lives at [Aleph Alpha Docs](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/).

## Models Available

You may use **any model** visible in your **PhariaStudio Playground** workspace, including:

- Generation Models (e.g., `llama-3.1-8b-instruct`, `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`, etc.)
- Embedding Models (e.g., `pharia-1-embedding-4608-control`, `pharia-1-embedding-256-control`)

Select the model in your flow configuration or switch interactively in the Playground.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a PhariaAI Application

Follow the official [Pharia Applications Quick Start Guide](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/products/pharia-ai/pharia-studio/tutorial/pharia-applications-quick-start/) to create a new application in Pharia Studio.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Database

We use a SQLite3-compatible version of the Northwind database.

* Clone the repo and set up the database following this guide:
  👉 [Northwind-SQLite3 Setup](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3)

---

### 3. Build a Generation Skill


*Note*: As it is crucial to include the database structure in the prompt, we provide a script `utils/db_service.py` that connects to the SQLite database and extracts the schema in a structured SQL format suitable for prompting:

```sql
-- Example schema output
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    CompanyName TEXT,
    ContactName TEXT,
    ...
);
```

In addition to schema extraction, the `db_service.py` script can also be used in the **backend of the application** to:

* Maintain a persistent connection to the SQLite database.
* Execute SQL queries generated by the skill and return query results to the frontend for display.


#### 3.1 Upload Few-Shot Examples to the Document Index (DI)

* Create a **Collection** and **Index** in DI.
* Upload [Few-shot examples](data/DI/examples.json) using the Intelligence Layer.

  * Use `question` as the **document content**.
  * Use `query` as the **document metadata**.

#### 3.2 Prompt Engineering

* Design system and user prompts for few-shot inference.
* Include the **database schema** in the prompt. You can use `db_service.py` to extract the schema in a format like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (...);
CREATE TABLE Orders (...);
...
```

#### 3.3 Evaluate the Skill (DevCsi & Benchmarking)

##### a. Wrap Skill as an Evaluation Task

Instead of querying through the deployed skill, use `DevCsi` to wrap the logic in a `Task`.

```python
from intelligence_layer.core import NoOpTracer, Task, TaskSpan
from pharia_skill.testing import DevCsi
from qa import Input, Output, custom_rag

class SQLGenerationTask(Task[Input, Output]):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.dev_csi = DevCsi().with_studio(project=PHARIA_STUDIO_PROJECT_NAME)

    def do_run(self, input: Input, task_span: TaskSpan) -> Output:
        start_time = time.time()
        output = custom_rag(self.dev_csi, input)
        duration = time.time() - start_time

        return Output(answer=output.answer, duration=duration)


```

##### b. Create Evaluation Dataset

* Use [100 curated test examples](data/test-data/examples.json).
* Each entry includes a natural language question and its expected SQL query.
* Schemas for all 5 databases in the evaluation set are located in:
  `data/test-data/database_schema/`

##### c. Define Evaluation & Aggregation Logic

* Use **LLM-as-a-Judge** to verify if the generated SQL leads to correct outputs.
* Track additional metrics like generation latency.

##### d. Run Benchmarks

Once the task and evaluation logic are in place, benchmark across:

* Different models.
* Prompt templates and variations.

---

### Step 4: Deploy the Skill

Ensure you've defined all required environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
PHARIA_AI_TOKEN=
PHARIA_KERNEL_ADDRESS=

SKILL_REGISTRY=
SKILL_REPOSITORY=
SKILL_REGISTRY_USER=
SKILL_REGISTRY_TOKEN=
```

Then use the `pharia-skill` CLI to:

```bash
pharia-skill build qa
pharia-skill publish qa.wasm --name sql-gen
```

Update the `namespace.toml` file with your skill's name. You can now test the deployed skill using the `PhariaKernel` [API](https://pharia-kernel.partner.stage.product.pharia.com/api-docs).

---

### Step 5: Update the UI

Once the skill is live:

* Connect the UI to the skill endpoint.
* Modify the frontend to:

  * Display the **generated SQL query**.
  * **Run** the query against the SQLite3 database.
  * Present the **results in a table format**.

---

### Step 6: Run Application in Preview Mode

Use the following script to test your application locally:

```bash
npx @aleph-alpha/pharia-ai-cli preview
```

---

### Step 7: Deploy the Application to Pharia Assistant

Before deployment:

* Ensure your `.env` file includes all required credentials and config variables.
```env
PHARIA_AI_TOKEN=
PHARIAOS_MANAGER_URL=

IMAGE_REGISTRY=
IMAGE_REPOSITORY=
IMAGE_REGISTRY_USER=
IMAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=
```
* Build and deploy:

```bash
npx @aleph-alpha/pharia-ai-cli publish
npx @aleph-alpha/pharia-ai-cli deploy
```
